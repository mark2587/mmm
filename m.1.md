# NAME

m - minimalistic media manager

# SYNOPSIS

m \[\<options>] \<command> \[\<command-specific-options>] \[\<args>]

# DESCRIPTION

m keeps track of which files you've played (or are still playing) and
thus allows you to easily continue playing the next file (using vlc or
mpv).

In order to avoid duplication, this man page is rather minimal.  More
help is available using:

    m --help      # global options & subcommands
    m ls --help   # subcommand (ls in this case) options & argument(s)
    m examples    # show some examples (from the tests)

See README.md for additional information and examples.  When installed
as a Debian package this should be available at
_/usr/share/doc/mmm/README.md.gz_.
